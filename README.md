A Python library implementing various Ising model simulations using **Monte Carlo methods**, including the **Metropolis** and **Wolff cluster algorithms** (used for efficient simulation near critical points).

The core analysis covers four main areas:
* **Self-Identity:** Incorporates a parameter ($\epsilon$) to model individual adherence to personal choice versus conformity with the social environment.
* **External Pressure ($H$):** Studies the effects of a global bias (analogous to external pressure) on the system, observing **nucleation points** and **hysteresis** phenomena.
* **Geometrical Effects:** Extends the model to 3D lattices and complex topologies, including **non-oriented, oriented graphs** and a **multi-component (dual-layer) coupled Ising model**.
* **Real Network Application:** Maps the model onto a **real student interaction network** to analyze **rumor propagation** and find physical properties like critical temperature and exponents for the specific graph structure.

**How to use our code ?**
- Open the file Ising.ipynb
- Run all the cells

Each cell will call the functions/data in the Github repository so it will quite fast to execute the entire notebook.
